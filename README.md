# Forest Beyond

Minecraft: Forest Beyond is the official modpack of "Die Retrospektive"

We are on the planet Proxima Centauri b. Mankind has fled from Earth in the hope of developing on this Earth-like planet. But the native dark monsters did not give the humans a chance and slaughtered them brutally. The SSOE (Space station for outer expeditions) sent their last rescuers to this planet to finally put an end to these monsters.
